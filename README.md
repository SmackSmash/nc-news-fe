# NC News

A react based front end consuming the [NC News API](https://github.com/SmackSmash/northcoders-news-be). It allows users to browse a range of articles, add/remove comments and view a list of users. A deployed version of the app can be found at [https://nc-news-danmoffat.netlify.app/](https://nc-news-danmoffat.netlify.app/). N.B. It may take up to a minute for the API to spin up on initial load.
